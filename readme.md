# Installation

From your `$HOME` directory:

```BASH
git clone https://github.com/bdelespierre/dotfiles.git .dotfiles
.dotfiles/install.sh
```

Then you may stow:

```BASH
cd .dotfiles
stow bash
stow git
stow vim
```

To use Sublime Text 3 configuration files:

- remove the User folder of the fresh install
- clone your backup (only the User folder)
- install Package Control
- restart Sublime Text

Enjoy!
